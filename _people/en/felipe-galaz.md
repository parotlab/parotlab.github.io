I am currently a graduate student supervised by Dr. María Estela Andrés and co-supervised by Vicenter Parot. I am interested in the interaction between the dopamine and serotonin systems in the striatum, particularly in relation to compulsive behavior. Specifically, I study the effects of repetitive administration of Quinpirole, a D2 receptor agonist, which causes locomotor sensitization and serves as a validated model for compulsive checking in rats. I want to employ optogenetics techniques to elucidate the mechanisms behind these neuroadaptive changes.
